## Title: Vol2bird

The Vol2bird virtual lab preprocesses KNMI weather radar data, and applies the Vol2bird algorithm to calculate vertical profiles of birds and other biological scatters. 
A fully automated method for the detection and quantification of bird migration was developed for operational C-band weather radar, 
measuring bird density, speed and direction as a function of altitude. 
These weather radar bird observations have been validated with data from a high-accuracy dedicated bird radar, 
which was stationed in the measurement volume of weather radar sites in The Netherlands, 
Belgium and France for a full migration season during autumn 2007 and spring 2008. 
We show that weather radar can extract near real-time bird density altitude profiles that closely correspond to the density profiles measured by dedicated bird radar. 
Doppler weather radar can thus be used as a reliable sensor for quantifying bird densities aloft in an operational setting, 
which—when extended to multiple radars—enables the mapping and continuous monitoring of bird migration flyways.
