title: Virtual lab roles
---
I propose the following role division for the vol2bird lab:

* Virtual lab development roles: Roles involved in the creation of a new virtual lab.
  * **Virtual lab owner / Principal investigator -> Berend Wijers:** Coordinates the development of the virtual lab with a scientific vision.
  This will often be the golden user, i.e. the person that provides the initial publishable use case of the virtual lab.
    * *Or should this role be filled by an additonal person who is also involved with vol2bird?*
  * **Virtual lab core developers -> Berend Wijers:** Develop a new virtual lab in NaaVRE. Often the virtual lab owner will be one of the core developers.
  * **Virtual lab code reviewers -> Scientist from the IBED Animal Movement Ecology & Koen:** Provide feedback during co-development on the user-friendliness, maintainability, and robustness of the
  source code and other assets.
    * *Should we try to find a person who has similar experience as a potential workshop participant?*
* Virtual lab support roles: Roles to support development and use of virtual labs.
  * **Virtual lab trainer -> Berend Wijers:** Knows the lab from a user viewpoint and provides trainings to new users. This role will often be assigned to a person who is also the virtual lab owner, a core developer, or service operator.
  * **Virtual lab technical coordinator -> Koen:** Knows the lab from a technical perspective and pushes the lab to the next readiness level. Often, this will be an employee at LifeWatch ERIC VLIC
  * **Virtual lab service operator -> Koen:** Can support users. Knows the potential and limitations of the lab and can help out when problems arise.
  * **Virtual research environment development and operations (VRE DevOps) engineer -> Spiros, Gabriel, Koen:** Maintains NaaVRE. Often, this will be an employee at LifeWatch ERIC VLIC.
