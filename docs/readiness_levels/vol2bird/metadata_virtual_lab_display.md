title: Vol2bird virtual lab
---
**Short summary:** The Vol2bird virtual lab preprocesses KNMI weather radar data, and applies the Vol2bird algorithm to calculate vertical profiles of birds and other biological scatters. 

**Concept description** The virtual lab imports weather radar data from an API, maps it to a format readable by the vol2bird algorithm, 
which produces a vertical profile of bird migration.  
This virtual lab makes use of the existing algorithm Vol2bird, which is wrapped in this virtual lab to make it easy to use.

### Use cases
In this virtual lab, you can:
- Select a date range to create a vertical profiles of bird migration.
- Write your own pre-processor to map other weather radar data to a format readable by vol2bird.

The following guidelines can be used to determine the completeness of a user manual.


* There is a description of the standards used for data exchange with application programming interfaces and databases.
* The intended audience is described. Recommended prior knowledge is listed.
* Storage location
  * Store the user manual for the virtual lab in the same git repository as the virtual lab assets.
  * The user manual will be made available on [NaaVRE.net](https://naavre.net/) and should be separated from the codebase.
  * Instructions on how to use a single notebook can be stored in the markdown of that notebook.
