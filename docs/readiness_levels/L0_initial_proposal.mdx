title: L0 - initial proposal
---
### Start situation
A new virtual lab starts with potential (golden) users who are willing to use NaaVRE to conduct research.
They will be selected, or reached out. The (golden) user will propose a virtual lab based on a scientific story
and technical starting point.
If a NaaVRE virtual lab seems the best platform to conduct the research,
the potential (golden) users and NaaVRE DevOps team work out the idea further, recruit a team of core developers,
establish ambitions, and make a timeline for the virtual lab.

### During the initial proposal phase
The following things should be done to work out the initial proposal to a concrete virtual lab:

* Feasibility
  * Check if the idea research activity can be done in NaaVRE.
* Team recruitment
  * Find a team of core developers to build the virtual lab.
* Plan
  * Write a development plan for the virtual lab. What scientific scenario will be investigated and what is needed to enable that?
  * Make a timeline for the co-development, validation of the virtual lab and development of training material.
* Licensing
  * Choose a license for the virtual lab. We recommend using the [Apache license 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/),
assuming this is compatible with the other packages and software you use in the virtual lab. If the Apache License 2.0 is incompatible with software or libraries used,
you can pick another license. We recommend having a look at https://choosealicense.com/.
* Codebase
  * Create a new virtual lab.
* Version control
  * Store of the codebase on a repository with version control (e.g. git).
* Documentation
  * Pick a nice name for your virtual lab. Make sure the name won't be mixed up with other virtual labs.

### Initial proposal responsibilities
The following roles are involved in a initial proposal:

* Community supporter: Reaches out to domain scientists who have the potential of becoming golden users.
* Golden users: Have a use case that will serve as the first application of the virtual lab.
Recruits a core development team.
* Virtual lab coordinator: The virtual lab gets a coordinator assigned.
Consults domain and technical experts to assess the whether running the virtual lab in NaaVRE is realistic.
 The coordinator ensures the golden users are onboarded onto NaaVRE and the readiness level framework.
* VRE DevOps engineer: Establish if NaaVRE can support to use case. Create an empty new virtual lab.

### Initial proposal milestones
The following milestones can be achieved during the phase L0 of virtual lab development:

* The core development team becomes complete.
* The creation of a new empty virtual lab.

### Exit conditions
To transition from initial proposal to co-development an ambitious but realistic virtual lab proposal should exist.
The following should be done:

* Plan
  - [ ] There is an ambitious and realistic development plan for the virtual lab.
  - [ ] A timeline exists for the co-development, validation of the virtual lab and development of training material.
* Codebase
  - [ ] A new virtual lab is created.
* Version control
  - [ ] The codebase repository has version control (e.g. git).
* Security
  - [ ] Personal tokens for APIs do not end up in version control. ToDo VLIC: Guideline for secret management [#276](https://github.com/QCDIS/projects_overview/issues/276).
* Licensing
  - [ ] The virtual lab has a license.
* Documentation
  - [ ] The virtual lab has a nice name.
