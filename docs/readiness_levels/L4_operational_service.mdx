---
The following should be done during operational service:

* Expand and adapt the virtual lab where useful or necessary.
* Make the containerized cells and workflow interoperable with other systems where use cases for the interoperability between NaaVRE and another system arise.

### Operational service milestones
The following milestones can occur when a virtual lab runs as an operational service:

* Users of the virtual lab successfully run their own scenarios in the virtual lab.
* Virtual lab developers make their own modifications to the virtual lab to facilitate their research.
* Users come up with ideas that spawn the creation of a new virtual lab:
Whenever users of the virtual lab come up with a new idea that does not fit in the possibilities of existing virtual labs,
they can contact LifeWatch to discuss the possibilities of creating a new virtual lab.

### Operational service responsibilities
The following responsibilities should be assigned when the virtual lab is an operational service:

* Virtual lab owner / Principal investigator: Coordinates the further development of the virtual lab with a scientific vision.
* Virtual lab service operator: Is the primary point of contact in case any problems arise with the virtual lab.
* Virtual lab technical coordinator: Ensures the VRE keeps supporting the virtual lab.
