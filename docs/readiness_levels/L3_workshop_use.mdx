### Start situation
At the start of level 3, the documentation and scientific publication is ready for silver users to learn the practices in workshops, trainings, and hackathons.

### During the workshop use phase
During this phase silver users are invited to join workshops, trainings, or hackathons to learn the features and
 components developed in the virtual lab and conduct their own exercises.

The following should be done during workshop use:

* Documentation
  * Gather user feedback on the documentation.
* Codebase
  * Find out if the architecture of the virtual lab is understandable and maintainable.

### Workshop use milestone
In this phase at least one workshop should be given to a group of 10 to 25 potential users.
Additionally, user feedback should be gathered and processed.

### Workshop use responsibilities
The following responsibilities should be assigned during workshop use:

* Golden users: The golden users who have used the virtual lab for their own investigations,
will appoint or approve a principal investogator for the virtual lab.
* Virtual lab principal investigator: Gathers user feedback and determines how to facilitate other users in the virtual lab.
* Community supporter: <L3CommunitySupporter/>
* Virtual lab trainer: Gives trainings to users. Can point out what the user can change and can not change in the lab.
* User supporter: Answers any technical questions arising from the workshop use which the trainer can not answer.
* Infrastructure supporter: Ensures the infrastructure can support the training sessions.
* Virtual lab coordinator: Monitors the virtual lab and any problems arising during training.
Checks whether the needed principal investigator and user community emerges during this phase that provides a use case for maturing the virtual lab further.

### Exit conditions
The virtual lab becomes an operational service if scientists taking part in the workshops, trainings, and hackathons
 find that they can use the virtual lab in their research, and the training material and guidelines are ready for normal (ivory) users to use.
In case none of the silver users keeps using the virtual labs after the workshops, the virtual lab should be archived.
All previous criteria apply in addition to the following:

* Community
  * [ ] There is a virtual lab principal investogator or community of scientists who are willing to take care of the scientific
  direction of the virtual lab.
  * [ ] The is a community of users who benefit from doing their research in the virtual lab.
* Dependencies
  * [ ] Dependencies are specified. The dependencies are in the dockerfile of the virtual lab,
but should be duplicated in the metadata such that a person can in theory also run the source code on their own machine after installing the dependencies manually.
* Deployment
  * [ ] Deploy the virtual lab on MyLifeWatch.
