---
The following should be done during workshop use:

* Documentation
  * Gather user feedback on the documentation.
* Codebase
  * Find out if the architecture of the virtual lab is understandable and maintainable.

### Workshop use milestone
In this phase at least one workshop should be given to a group of 10 to 25 potential users.
Additionally, user feedback should be gathered and processed.

### Workshop use responsibilities
The following responsibilities should be assigned during workshop use:

* Virtual lab owner / Principal investigator: Gathers user feedback and determines how to facilitate other users in the virtual lab.
* Virtual lab trainer: Gives trainings to users. Can point out what the user can change and can not change in the lab.
* Virtual lab technical coordinator: Answers any technical questions arising from the workshop use which the trainer can not answer.
Has been involved as VRE DevOps engineer during the previous stages.

### From workshop use to operational service
The virtual lab is an operational service if all previous criteria apply and additionally the following criteria apply:

* Dependencies
  * [ ] Dependencies are specified. The dependencies are in the dockerfile of the virtual lab,
but should be duplicated in the metadata such that a person can in theory also run the source code on their own machine after installing the dependencies manually.
* Deployment
  * [ ] Deploy the virtual lab on MyLifeWatch.
