import * as Responsibilities from './Responsibilities.js';

### Start situation
At the start of level 3, the documentation and scientific publication is ready for silver users to learn the practices in workshops, trainings, and hackathons.

### During the workshop use phase
During this phase silver users are invited to join workshops, trainings, or hackathons to learn the features and
 components developed in the virtual lab and conduct their own exercises.

The following should be done during workshop use:

* Documentation
  * Gather user feedback on the documentation.
* Codebase
  * Find out if the architecture of the virtual lab is understandable and maintainable.

### Workshop use milestone
In this phase at least one workshop should be given to a group of 10 to 25 potential users.
Additionally, user feedback should be gathered and processed.

### Workshop use responsibilities
The following responsibilities should be assigned during workshop use:

* Golden users: <Responsibilities.L3GoldenUser/>
* Virtual lab principal investigator: <Responsibilities.L3PrincipalInvestigator/>
* Community supporter: <Responsibilities.L3CommunitySupporter/>
* Virtual lab trainer: <Responsibilities.L3Trainer/>
* User supporter: <Responsibilities.L3UserSupporter/>
* Infrastructure supporter: <Responsibilities.L3InfrastructureSupporter/>
* Virtual lab coordinator: <Responsibilities.L3Coordinator/>

### Exit conditions
The virtual lab becomes an operational service if scientists taking part in the workshops, trainings, and hackathons
 find that they can use the virtual lab in their research, and the training material and guidelines are ready for normal (ivory) users to use.
In case none of the silver users keeps using the virtual labs after the workshops, the virtual lab should be archived.
All previous criteria apply in addition to the following:

* Community
  * [ ] There is a virtual lab principal investogator or community of scientists who are willing to take care of the scientific
  direction of the virtual lab.
  * [ ] The is a community of users who benefit from doing their research in the virtual lab.
* Dependencies
  * [ ] Dependencies are specified. The dependencies are in the dockerfile of the virtual lab,
but should be duplicated in the metadata such that a person can in theory also run the source code on their own machine after installing the dependencies manually.
* Deployment
  * [ ] Deploy the virtual lab on MyLifeWatch.
