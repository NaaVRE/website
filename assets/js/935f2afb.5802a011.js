High-rises, wind farms and airports all contribute to conflict with aerial organisms. Information about the movements of organisms in the air is required to identify stop-over sites, migratory routes, and patterns. This can inform mitigation of conflicts by, for example, wind-turbine curtailments or early warning systems for aviation. Weather radars, that continuously monitor the sky across continents, can be used to study movements of birds, bats, and insects. However, for continental scale analysis, large volumes of data are required to be processed and analyzed, which often rely on institute-specific tools and computational resources. This severely hampers collaborative efforts because of the initial investment of time and resources to gain access to existing computing infrastructure. Here we show a Radar Aeroecology Virtual Research Environment (RAVRE) which uses the Lifewatch ERIC infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and re-use of infrastructure and tools. By providing RAVRE, we aim to facilitate collaboration between ornithological institutes."},"readiness_levels/RAVRE/L0_conceptual_proposal":{"id":"readiness_levels/RAVRE/L0_conceptual_proposal","title":"L0 - Conceptual proposal","description":"Conceptual proposal milestones"},"readiness_levels/RAVRE/L1_co-development":{"id":"readiness_levels/RAVRE/L1_co-development","title":"L1_co-development","description":"Co-development milestones"},"readiness_levels/RAVRE/L2_validation_phase":{"id":"readiness_levels/RAVRE/L2_validation_phase","title":"L2_validation_phase","description":"Validation phase milestones"},"readiness_levels/RAVRE/roles":{"id":"readiness_levels/RAVRE/roles","title":"Virtual lab roles","description":"I propose the following role division for the RAVRE lab:"},"readiness_levels/user_manual":{"id":"readiness_levels/user_manual","title":"User manual","description":"The following guidelines can be used to determine the completeness of a user manual."},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Community_supporter":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Community_supporter","title":"Community supporter","description":"The community supporter has the following responsibilities per level:"},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Coordinator":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Coordinator","title":"Virtual lab coordinator","description":"The virtual lab coordinator has the following responsibilities per level:"},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Core_developer":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Core_developer","title":"Core developer","description":"Core developers create the content of the new virtual lab, being steered by the golden users."},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/DevOps":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/DevOps","title":"Virtual research environment development and operations (VRE DevOps) engineer","description":"The VRE DevOps engineers have the following responsibilities per level:"},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Golden_user":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Golden_user","title":"Golden user","description":"Golden users have the following responsibilities per level:"},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Infrastructure_supporter":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Infrastructure_supporter","title":"Infrastructure supporter","description":"The infrastructure supporter contributes the following per level:"},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Reviewer":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Reviewer","title":"Reviewer","description":"The reviewer can contribute the following per level:"},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Steering_board":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Steering_board","title":"Scientific steering board","description":"The scientific steering board decides on the further development of the virtual lab based on a scientific vision and their knowledge of the use cases of the virtual lab."},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Trainer":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/Trainer","title":"Trainer","description":"The trainer contributes the following per level:"},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/User_supporter":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/User_supporter","title":"User supporter","description":"The user supporter contributes the following per level:"},"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/VRE_researcher":{"id":"readiness_levels/Virtual_lab_roles/VRE_researcher","title":"VRE researcher","description":"The VRE researcher contributes the following per level:"},"tutorials/index":{"id":"tutorials/index","title":"Getting Started with NaaVRE tutorial","description":"The aim of this tutorial is to discover the basic functionalities of NaaVRE","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
